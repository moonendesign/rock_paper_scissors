Console version of Rock Paper Scissors

Main objective is to create a game of rock paper scissors in the console.
I started by setting up the index.html and script.js file and make sure everything works correctly. (done)
After that i will wright the logic where the computer chooses a hand. 
Then create a way to ask the player for input. (It has to be all lower case and the input must be equal to rock, paper or scissors)
